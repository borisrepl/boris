# Boris: A tiny little REPL for PHP

Quick video demo: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDDZHAvzHvQ

Python has one. Ruby has one. Clojure has one. Now PHP has one too. Boris is
PHP's missing REPL (read-eval-print loop), allowing developers to experiment
with PHP code in the terminal in an interactive manner.  If you make a mistake,
it doesn't matter, Boris will report the error and stand to attention for
further input.

Everything you enter into Boris is evaluated and the result `var_dump()`'d
for inspection.  State is maintained between inputs, allowing you to gradually
build up a solution to a problem.

## Why?

I'm in the process of transitioning away from PHP to Ruby.  I have come to find
PHP's lack of a real REPL to be frustrating and was not able to find an existing
implementation that was complete.  Boris weighs in at a few hundred lines of
fairly straightforward code.

## Usage

I'll probably make this available via Composer/Packagist, but right now you can get Boris
from github:

    git clone git://github.com/d11wtq/boris.git
    cd boris
    ./bin/boris

When Boris starts, you will be at the `boris>` prompt. PHP code you enter at
this prompt is evaluated.  If an expression spans multiple lines, Boris will
collect the input and then evaluate the expression when it is complete.  The
output is dumped with `var_dump()`.

    boris> $x = 1;
    int(1)
    boris> $y = 2;
    int(2)
    boris> "x + y = " . ($x + $y);
    string(9) "x + y = 3"
    boris> exit;

You can also use Boris as part of a larger project (e.g. with your application
environment loaded).

    require_once 'lib/boris.php';

    $boris = new \Boris\Boris('myapp> ');
    $boris->start();

The constructor parameter is optional and changes the prompt.

## What about PHP's interactive mode?

PHP's interactive mode does not print the result of evaluating expressions and
more importantly, it exits if you type something that produces a fatal error,
such as invoking a function/method that does not exist, or an uncaught
exception.  Boris is designed to be robust, like other REPLs, so you can
experiment with things that you know may error, without losing everything.

## Architecture Overview

This section of the README only applies to those curious enough to read the
code.

Boris will only work on POSIX systems (Linux and Mac OS).  This is primarily
because it depends on the ability to fork. If anybody knows how to make this
approach work in Windows, do submit a pull request.

Boris is composed of two parts:

  1. A REPL worker process, which receives expressions to evaluate and print
  2. A readline client, which simply takes your input, sends it to the worker
     and then loops

If all errors in PHP were exceptions, building a REPL would be simple. This is
not the case, however.  Some PHP errors are truly fatal and cannot be caught.
In order to prevent such fatal errors from killing the REPL, the worker looks
something like this:

    for(;;) {
      $input = accept_some_input();
      if (fork_child()) {
        wait_for_child();
      } else { // inside child
        var_dump(eval($input));
        kill_parent();
      }
    }

The child is forked with all current variables and resources.  It evaluates the
input then kills the parent, then the loop continues inside the child, waiting
for the next input.

While the child is evaluating the input, the parent waits. The parent is
expecting the worst—that the child will die abnormally—at which point the parent
continues waiting for input and does not terminate.  The state remains unchanged.

After each expression is evaluated, the worker reports back to the main process
with a status code of 0 (keep running) or 1 (terminate).

The main process (readline) of Boris is much more straightforward.  It takes
your input, performs a (very) shallow parse on it, in order to decide if it
needs to wait for further input, or evaluate the input (one statement at a time)
it has received.  If the worker reports back with a status code of 1, the process
terminates, otherwise the next iteration of the loop is entered.

## Will it work with...?

Boris depends on the following PHP features:

  - The Readline functions
  - The PCNTL functions
  - The POSIX functions
  - The Socket functions

It has been written in PHP 5.3, but should work in PHP 5.2.  It will not work in
PHP 4.  There's no chance it can work on Windows, due to the dependency on POSIX
features.
